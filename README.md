# GUI-Blackjack

Welcome to my GUI Blackjack project! This was developed using Java Swing with the game logic, calculations, and GUI layout management done entirely by me as a challenge! This was developed using VS Code, and uses Maven to layout the project. I still haven't exported this project into a .jar application, so it must be run using VS Code in order to work (I think).

# Issues?

So far, there is a small issue when it comes to calculating the score that leads to an incorrect outcome. Don't really understand the issue itself, so help would be appreciated.
